## Problem and Solution

1. **Problem:**
   Web3 games often have complicated onboarding — players need to register, connect wallets, and understand crypto systems before even playing.
   **Solution:**
   We integrated **IDos Games SDK**, which allows players to log in quickly and automatically connect to the Sovana ecosystem without extra setup.

2. **Problem:**
   Developers participating in short-term jams rarely have time to build blockchain or crypto integrations from scratch.
   **Solution:**
   We used the **IDos Games SDK** to add basic Web3 features (login, rewards, Sovana currency connection) within a few days.

3. **Problem:**
   Many blockchain projects are purely technical and forget about gameplay.
   **Solution:**
   Our focus was to create a **simple, playable game** first — and then connect it to the Web3 layer through **IDos Games** integration.
